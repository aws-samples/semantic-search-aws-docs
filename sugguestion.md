Hi Malte, I came across your repository yesterday and I want to thank you on the excellent work you have put into it. 

However, I've encountered some difficulty in understanding the instructions provided for "Ingesting your own documents". Specifically, I am unsure about the process of setting up the backend for the application when using my own files for embeddings.

As I understand it, the first step would seem to be to upload the required files into the /semantic-search-aws-docs/ingestion/awsdocs/data directory. However, the subsequent steps are somewhat unclear to me.

I kindly request if you could update your instructions with a more detailed guide on how to use local files for the application. This additional clarification would greatly assist me, and likely others, in utilizing this application to its full potential.

I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration, and once again, thank you for your outstanding work on this repository!
